# Project Name

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

For this project #4 we focused on basic JavaScript concepts like variables, conditionals, and native methods, Using alert() and prompt() to collect information from our customers

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

This time I was very focus in all the information we got from Disco, and I was focusing in 1 step at the time. I started by trying to understand the logic of each element, such as =, ==, ===, let, const, etc. 

I would say that 90% of the time I was reading and collecting information from W3school and stack overflow, I tried to use chatgpt but sometimes it was giving me a very different way of building the project, I believe with more advance variables and conditionals.

If I had more time I would like to make it with the options that chatgpt suggested to see if it work better.
